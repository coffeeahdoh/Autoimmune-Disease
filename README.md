## Autoimmune Disease

(Analyses are still in progress as of 19-11-2022)

The intention of this project is to analyze various publicly available 
datasets related to Autoimmune Diseases (AI), including burden, quality of 
life, and genetics/genomics.

** The analyses herein may only pertain to particular groups. **

## Part 1

Part 1 of this project is based on a multi-site and support group survey 
data collected in Germany from April to October 2021 [Schulz et al. 2022].

Based on this data I intend to explore the differences between men and 
women with AI disease, if quality of life generally improves from onset, 
and which age group has significantly higher burden of therapy

## Part 2
